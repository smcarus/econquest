## [Unreleased]

- Ready-made app image: each public release publishes the app to GitHub's image store
  (ghcr.io/e-conquest/econquest), for Intel/AMD and Apple Silicon/ARM machines, so nobody has to build it.
- docs/INSTALL.md: a plain-language install guide for people new to this, with deploy/quick-start/compose.yml.
- docs/METHODOLOGY.md: the methodology document (version 1.0) for the website and the public release.
- G20 Members watchlist: all 19 G20 member countries, first on the list for new users and added once
  for existing users. The twelve new countries draw on the same free feeds; figures with no source read Missing with the reason.
